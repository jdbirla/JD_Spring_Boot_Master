# Spring , SpringBoot Inerview Questions and Answers

## Spring

**1. What is Loose Coupling?**

Loose coupling is a design principle in software engineering that promotes reducing dependencies between components or modules in a system. In the context of Spring and other software frameworks, loose coupling means that components or classes are designed to interact with each other with minimal dependencies. This allows for greater flexibility and ease of maintenance, as changes in one component are less likely to impact others.

In the Spring framework, loose coupling is achieved through features like dependency injection, where components are wired together externally (usually through configuration) rather than being tightly coupled by creating instances of dependent classes within a class. This reduces the direct reliance on specific implementations and makes it easier to swap or modify components without affecting the entire system.

**2. What is a Dependency?**

A dependency is a relationship between two components or classes in a software system where one component relies on another to perform a certain task or provide a service. Dependencies in software can be in the form of method calls, object instantiation, or any other type of interaction between components. Managing dependencies effectively is a fundamental aspect of software design and modularity.

In the context of Spring, dependencies often refer to the relationships between Spring beans or components, where one bean requires another to perform its function. Spring manages these dependencies through dependency injection, allowing beans to be injected with the required dependencies rather than creating them internally.

**3. What is IOC (Inversion of Control)?**

Inversion of Control (IoC) is a design principle where the control over the flow of a program is shifted from the program itself to a framework or container. In other words, in IoC, the control is inverted or "inverted" from the application code to a container or framework, which manages the creation and lifecycle of components.

In the context of Spring, IoC means that the Spring container manages the creation, configuration, and lifecycle of Spring beans (components) and also handles the injection of dependencies. This approach promotes loose coupling and makes it easier to change the behavior of a component by configuring it in the Spring container, rather than hardcoding dependencies or configurations within the component.

**4. What is Dependency Injection?**

Dependency Injection (DI) is a core concept in the Spring framework that implements the IoC principle. It's a design pattern where components receive their dependencies from an external source rather than creating them. Spring manages this process, allowing you to inject the required dependencies into a component, typically through constructor injection, setter injection, or method injection.

Examples of Dependency Injection in Spring:

- Constructor Injection:
  ```java
  public class MyService {
      private final MyRepository repository;

      public MyService(MyRepository repository) {
          this.repository = repository;
      }
  }
  ```

- Setter Injection:
  ```java
  public class MyService {
      private MyRepository repository;

      @Autowired
      public void setRepository(MyRepository repository) {
          this.repository = repository;
      }
  }
  ```

- Method Injection:
  ```java
  public class MyService {
      public void processData(MyRepository repository) {
          // Use the repository here
      }
  }
  ```

**5. Can you give a few examples of Dependency Injection?**

I've already provided examples in the previous answer for constructor injection, setter injection, and method injection. These are the three common ways to achieve dependency injection in Spring. If you'd like more examples or have specific questions about them, please let me know, and I'll provide further details.

For now, let's continue with the next question.

**6. What is Auto Wiring?**

Auto-wiring is a Spring feature that allows the Spring container to automatically resolve and inject dependencies into Spring beans without the need for explicit configuration. It simplifies the process of wiring components together, reducing the need for extensive XML or Java configuration.

There are several modes of auto-wiring in Spring:

- **No Auto-wiring (default)**: No auto-wiring is performed, and you need to explicitly specify dependencies in your configuration.

- **By Type**: Spring will search for a bean of the same data type and inject it if found.

- **By Name**: Spring will search for a bean with the same name as the property and inject it if found.

- **By Constructor**: Constructor arguments are matched to the available beans by type.

- **By Qualifier**: You can use the `@Qualifier` annotation to specify which bean to inject when multiple beans of the same type are available.

- **Autowire (deprecated in Spring 4.2)**: This was an older, more explicit form of auto-wiring.

**7. What are the important roles of an IOC Container?**

The Inversion of Control (IoC) container, such as the Spring container, plays several important roles in managing components and their dependencies:

- **Bean instantiation**: The container creates and manages instances of beans (components) based on the bean definitions in the configuration.

- **Dependency injection**: The container injects dependencies into beans, satisfying their requirements for collaborating components.

- **Lifecycle management**: The container manages the lifecycle of beans, including their creation, initialization, and destruction.

- **Configuration management**: It manages configuration information and externalizes it from application code.

- **Aspect management**: It supports aspects, allowing you to apply cross-cutting concerns (such as logging and security) to your application.

- **AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming)**: The container supports AOP to implement aspects, allowing for cleaner separation of concerns in your code.

- **Resource management**: It manages and provides access to resources such as databases, JMS queues, and external services.

**8. What are Bean Factory and Application Context?**

- **Bean Factory**: Bean Factory is the simplest form of the Spring IoC container. It is the central interface for accessing and managing beans in a Spring application. It provides basic functionality for managing beans but lacks some of the advanced features offered by `ApplicationContext`.

- **Application Context**: Application Context is a more feature-rich container and extends the functionality of the Bean Factory. It includes features like internationalization, event propagation, and message resource handling. It's the recommended choice for most applications. `ClassPathXmlApplicationContext` and `AnnotationConfigApplicationContext` are examples of application contexts.

**9. Can you compare Bean Factory with Application Context?**

Here's a comparison of Bean Factory and Application Context:

- **Configuration Loading**:
  - **Bean Factory**: Loads bean definitions lazily.
  - **Application Context**: Loads bean definitions eagerly. It performs validation and eagerly creates singleton beans.

- **Resource Access**:
  - **Bean Factory**: Doesn't provide access to resources like internationalization messages, events, etc.
  - **Application Context**: Provides access to resources and offers more extensive features.

- **Internationalization**:
  - **Bean Factory**: Lacks internationalization support.
  - **Application Context**: Provides support for internationalization and localization.

- **Event Propagation**:
  - **Bean Factory**: Limited support for event propagation.
  - **Application Context**: Supports event propagation for decoupled components.

- **Message Resolution**:
  - **Bean Factory**: Doesn't support message resolution.
  - **Application Context**: Supports message resource handling.

In practice, most Spring applications use `ApplicationContext` because it offers a broader range of features. You should choose between the two based on your specific requirements.
